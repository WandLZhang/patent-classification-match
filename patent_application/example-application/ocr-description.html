                        labels associated therewith. Image classifier may be configured to output at least a datum that labels or otherwise identifies
                        a set of images that are clustered together, found to be close under a distance metric as described below, or the like. Computing
                        device <b>104</b> and/or another device may generate image classifier using a classification algorithm, defined as a process whereby computing
                        device <b>104</b> derives a classifier from training data. Classification may be performed using, without limitation, linear classifiers such
                        as without limitation logistic regression and/or naive Bayes classifiers, nearest neighbor classifiers such as k-nearest neighbors
                        classifiers, support vector machines, least squares support vector machines, fisher's linear discriminant, quadratic classifiers,
                        decision trees, boosted trees, random forest classifiers, learning vector quantization, and/or neural network-based classifiers.
                        In some cases, processor <b>108</b> may use an image classifier to identify a key image in data described in any data described in this disclosure. As used herein,
                        a &#8220;key image&#8221; is an element of visual data used to identify and/or match elements to each other. An image classifier may be
                        trained with binarized visual data that has already been classified to determine key images in any other data described in
                        this disclosure. &#8220;Binarized visual data&#8221; for the purposes of this disclosure is visual data that is described in binary format.
                        For example, binarized visual data of a photo may be comprised of ones and zeroes wherein the specific sequence of ones and
                        zeros may be used to represent the photo. Binarized visual data may be used for image recognition wherein a specific sequence
                        of ones and zeroes may indicate a product present in the image. An image classifier may be consistent with any classifier
                        as discussed herein. An image classifier may receive input data (e.g. overlay image <b>120</b>) described in this disclosure and output a key image with the data (e.g. field background image and/or primary image <b>140</b>). In an embodiment, image classifier may be used to compare visual data in data such as overlay image <b>120</b> with visual data in another data set. Visual data in another data set may include a plurality of visual data retrieved from
                        database <b>116</b>. In some cases, image classifier may identify one or more components within overlay image <b>120</b> that may be unique and/or that may belong to fixed background image <b>124</b>. In one or more embodiments, processor <b>108</b> may employ pattern matching techniques to identify specific patterns or abnormalities within overlay image <b>120</b> in order to identify fixed background image <b>124</b> and/or primary image <b>140</b>. This can involve comparing specific segments, intervals, patterns, color gamut, and the like. Cross-correlation, template
                        matching, or dynamic time warping algorithms may be used for this purpose. In one or more embodiments, computing device <b>104</b> and/or processor <b>108</b> may contain an existing digital image of fixed background image <b>124</b>. In one or more embodiments, the existing digital image of fixed background image <b>124</b> may be compared to overlay image <b>120</b> wherein computing device <b>104</b> may compare various features within overlay image <b>120</b> and existing digital image of fixed background image <b>124</b>. Similarly, computing device <b>104</b> may utilize known and repetitive features of primary image <b>140</b> in order to identify primary image <b>140</b>. For example, and without limitation, while ECG signals may differ in two sets of primary images <b>140</b>, the presence of X-Y coordinates, the presence of a graph in general and the like may be used to identify primary image <b>140</b>.

In one or more embodiments, fixed background image <b>200</b> may serve as a test sheet in order to determine the quality of a photograph or a scan captured by an imaging device. In one
                        or more embodiment, fixed background image <b>200</b> may allow computing device and/or an individual to determine if a photo was captured with proper lighting, with proper contrast,
                        with proper color output and the like. In one or more embodiments, fixed background image <b>200</b> may include a color gamut <b>204</b> which may be used to determine if the color output of a captured image has been captured correctly. In one or more embodiments,
                        fixed background image <b>200</b> may include geometric patterns <b>208</b>. In one or more embodiments, geometric patterns may be used to determine if distortion has occurred if contrast has been
                        distorted and the like. In one or more embodiments, the geometric patterns may be used to figure out the intrinsic (focal
                        length, optical center) and extrinsic parameters of an imaging device (e.g. rotation and translation of the camera) as well
                        as distortion caused due to paper or lens used. In one or more embodiments, an imaging device may capture a test sheet, such
                        as fixed background image and identify corners of geometric patterns such as black and white squares. In one or more embodiments,
                        identifying corners allows the computing device to identify the positions of the black and white squares. These positions
                        may then be compared to the actual positions of the geometric patterns on fixed background image <b>200</b>. In one or more embodiments, comparison between actual and identified positions of geometric patterns using optimization
                        techniques such as Levenberg-Marquardt algorithms can be used to determine the imaging device's focal length, optical center,
                        distortion coefficients, rotation and the like. In one or more embodiments, processor <b>108</b> may use one or more machine vision systems in order to identify geometric patterns and/or colors in fixed background image
                        <b>200</b>. For example, in some cases a machine vision system may be used for world modeling or registration of objects within a space
                        such as fixed background image <b>200</b>. In some cases, registration may include image processing, such as without limitation object recognition, feature detection,
                        edge/corner detection, and the like. Non-limiting example of feature detection may include scale invariant feature transform
                        (SIFT), Canny edge detection, Shi Tomasi corner detection, and the like. In some cases, registration may include one or more
                        transformations to orient a camera frame (or an image or video stream) relative a three-dimensional coordinate system; exemplary
                        transformations include without limitation homography transforms and affine transforms. In an embodiment, registration of
                        first frame to a coordinate system may be verified and/or corrected using object identification and/or computer vision, as
                        described above. For instance, and without limitation, an initial registration to two dimensions, represented for instance
                        as registration to the x and y coordinates, may be performed using a two-dimensional projection of points in three dimensions
                        onto a first frame, however. A third dimension of registration, representing depth and/or a z axis, may be detected by comparison
                        of two frames; for instance, where first frame includes a pair of frames captured using a pair of cameras (e.g., stereoscopic
                        camera also referred to in this disclosure as stereo-camera), image recognition and/or edge detection software may be used
                        to detect a pair of stereoscopic views of images of an object; two stereoscopic views may be compared to derive z-axis values
                        of points on object permitting, for instance, derivation of further z-axis points within and/or around the object using interpolation.
                        This may be repeated with multiple objects in field of view, including without limitation environmental features of interest
                        identified by object classifier and/or indicated by an operator. In an embodiment, x and y axes may be chosen to span a plane
                        common to two cameras used for stereoscopic image capturing and/or an xy plane of a first frame; a result, x and y translational
                        components and ø may be pre-populated in translational and rotational matrices, for affine transformation of coordinates of
                        object, also as described above. Initial x and y coordinates and/or guesses at transformational matrices may alternatively
                        or additionally be performed between first frame and second frame, as described above. For each point of a plurality of points
                        on object and/or edge and/or edges of object as described above, x and y coordinates of a first stereoscopic frame may be
                        populated, with an initial estimate of z coordinates based, for instance, on assumptions about object, such as an assumption
                        that ground is substantially parallel to an xy plane as selected above. Z coordinates, and/or x, y, and z coordinates, registered
                        using image capturing and/or object identification processes as described above may then be compared to coordinates predicted
                        using initial guess at transformation matrices; an error function may be computed using by comparing the two sets of points,
                        and new x, y, and/or z coordinates, may be iteratively estimated and compared until the error function drops below a threshold
                        level. In some cases, a machine vision system may use a classifier, such as any classifier described throughout this disclosure.
                        In one or more embodiments, processor <b>108</b> may be configured to determine focal length by using known sizes and structures of geometric patterns and how they are projected
                        onto an image. In one or more embodiments, processor may compute distortion coefficients by identifying deviations in patterns
                        on fixed background image in comparison to their expected positions. In one or more embodiments, distortion coefficients may
                        include radial distortion which account for barrel r pincushion distortion wherein points are displaced radially from a center.
                        In one or more embodiments, distortion coefficients may include tangential coefficients in which lens misalignment may include
                        points to be displaced tangentially. In one or more embodiments, one or more edge detection algorithms as described above
                        may be used to identify the locations of various geometric patterns. In one or more embodiments, processor may use one or
                        more edge detection techniques to identify grids, patterns and the like within fixed background image. In one or more embodiments,
                        processor may define corresponding points for each pattern on fixed background image based on their relative position on fixed
                        background image. In one or more embodiments, processor may generate a matrix of points wherein changes in the matrix to expected
                        values in order to determine focal length, distortion coefficients and the like.

                        of high-frequency values below a threshold level may indicate blurriness. As a further non-limiting example, detection of

                        edges in the image, and thus are indicative of a lower degree of blurriness. Blur detection may be performed using Wavelet-based
                        operator, which takes advantage of the capability of coefficients of the discrete wavelet transform to describe the frequency

                        number of units, for instance by upsampling and interpolating. As a non-limiting example, a low pixel count image may have
                        100 pixels, however a desired number of pixels may be 128. Processor may interpolate the low pixel count image to convert
                        the 100 pixels into 128 pixels. It should also be noted that one of ordinary skill in the art, upon reading this disclosure,
                        would know the various methods to interpolate a smaller number of data units such as samples, pixels, bits, or the like to
                        a desired number of such units. In some instances, a set of interpolation rules may be trained by sets of highly detailed
                        inputs and/or outputs and corresponding inputs and/or outputs downsampled to smaller numbers of units, and a neural network
                        or other machine learning model that is trained to predict interpolated pixel values using the training data. As a non-limiting
                        example, a sample input and/or output, such as a sample picture, with sample-expanded data units (e.g., pixels added between
                        the original pixels) may be input to a neural network or machine-learning model and output a pseudo replica sample-picture
                        with dummy values assigned to pixels between the original pixels based on a set of interpolation rules. As a non-limiting
                        example, in the context of an image classifier, a machine-learning model may have a set of interpolation rules trained by
                        sets of highly detailed images and images that have been downsampled to smaller numbers of pixels, and a neural network or
                        other machine learning model that is trained using those examples to predict interpolated pixel values in a facial picture
                        context. As a result, an input with sample-expanded data units (the ones added between the original data units, with dummy
                        values) may be run through a trained neural network and/or model, which may fill in values to replace the dummy values. Alternatively
                        or additionally, processor, computing device, and/or module may utilize sample expander methods, a low-pass filter, or both.
                        As used in this disclosure, a &#8220;low-pass filter&#8221; is a filter that passes signals with a frequency lower than a selected cutoff
                        frequency and attenuates signals with frequencies higher than the cutoff frequency. The exact frequency response of the filter
                        depends on the filter design. Computing device, processor, and/or module may use averaging, such as luma or chroma averaging
                        in images, to fill in data units in between original data units.

                        unit in the neural network layer that is independent of the input to the layer. The weighted sum may then be input into a

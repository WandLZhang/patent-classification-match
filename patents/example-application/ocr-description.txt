                           The present invention generally relates to the field of image modification. In particular, the present invention is directed
                        to standardization of electrocardiogram signal images.
                     
                  
               
            
         
         
         BACKGROUND
         
         
            
               
                  
                           The image quality of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals on ECG strips and/other physical visualizations of electrocardiograms
                        signals may be influenced by camera characteristics such as auto-focus, flash, resolution, and image compression. Environmental
                        factors like document placement, camera angle, light sources, exposure time, and background colors may also impact image quality.
                        Current systems used to determine the image quality of ECG signals are lacking and can thus alter or skew determinations made
                        on the image.

                           With continued reference to FIG. 1, fixed background image 124 may include one or more electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. As used in the current disclosure, an “electrocardiogram signal”
                        is a signal representative of electrical activity of heart. The ECG signal may consist of several distinct waves and intervals,
                        each representing a different phase of the cardiac cycle. These waves may include the P-wave, QRS complex, T wave, U wave,
                        and the like. The P-wave may represent atrial depolarization (contraction) as the electrical impulse spreads through the atria.
                        The QRS complex may represent ventricular depolarization (contraction) as the electrical impulse spreads through the ventricles.
                        The QRS complex may include three waves: Q wave, R wave, and S wave. The T-wave may represent ventricular repolarization (recovery)
                        as the ventricles prepare for the next contraction. The U-wave may sometimes be present after the T wave, it represents repolarization
                        of the Purkinje fibers. The intervals between these waves may provide information about the duration and regularity of various
                        phases of the cardiac cycle. The ECG signal may help diagnose various heart conditions, such as arrhythmias, myocardial infarction
                        (heart attack), conduction abnormalities, and electrolyte imbalances. In one or more embodiments, ECG signals may be received
                        by one or more electrodes connected to the skin of an individual. In one or more embodiments, ECG signals may represent depolarization
                        and repolarization occurring in the heart. In one or more embodiments, ECG signals may be captured periodically. For example,
                        and without limitation, every second, every millisecond and the like. In one or more embodiments, ECG signals may contain
                        an associated time variable. A “Time variable” for the purposes of this disclosure is information indicating the time at which
                        a particular ECG signal was received. For example, and without limitation, time variable may include, 5 ms, 10 ms, 15 ms and
                        the like. In one or more embodiments, each ECG signal may contain a time variable. In one or more embodiments, time variable
                        may increase in given increments, such as for example, in increments of 5 ms, wherein a first time variable may include 5
                        ms and a second time variable may include 10 ms. In one or more embodiments, a combination of a plurality of ECG signals and
                        correlated time variable may be used to generate a graph illustrating the heart functions of an individual. In one or more
                        embodiments, fixed background image 124 may include a graphical representation of one or more electrocardiogram signals. In one or more embodiments, the graphical
                        representation may be in the form of an X-Y graph. In one or more embodiments, fixed background image 124 may include one or predetermined ECG signals to be used as reference for the quality of overlay image 120. In one or more embodiments, variations in the curvature of ECG signals depicted on fixed background image 124 within overlay image 120 may indicate that overlay image 120 may have been captured poorly. In one or more embodiments, one or more ECG signals may be depicted and/or illustrated in
                        fixed background image 124 and used to determine the performance of an imaging device 156. In one or more embodiments, fixed background image 124 may include a reference electrocardiogram signal 136. A “reference electrocardiogram signal” for the purposes of this disclosure is an ECG signal located on fixed background
                        image 124 and used to determine the performance of an imaging device 156 which was captured an image of fixed background image 124. For example, and without limitation, a reference ECG signal 136 may be present on fixed background image 124 wherein distortion or manipulation of reference electrocardiogram signal 136 in a captured image may indicate that the image was not captured properly. In one or more embodiments, reference ECG signal
                        136 may be used to determine the quality of overlay image 120. In one or more embodiments, computing device 104 may identify reference ECG signal 136 wherein variations in an image captured of reference ECG signal 136 may indicate that the image was not properly captured. In one or more embodiments, fixed background image 124 may have a size of A3. Reference ECG is described further in reference to at least FIG. 2.

                        sensors may be derived from the limb sensors and provide additional information about the heart's electrical activity. These
                        leads are calculated using specific combinations of the limb leads and help assess the electrical vectors in different orientations.
                        For example, aVR may be derived from Sensor II and Sensor III. In another example, aVL may be derived from sensor I and Sensor
                        III. Additionally, aVF may be derived from Lead I and Lead II. The combination of limb sensors, precordial sensors, and augmented
                        unipolar sensors allows for a comprehensive assessment of the heart's electrical activity in three dimensions. These leads
                        capture the electrical signals from different orientations, which are then transformed into transformed coordinates to generate
                        vectorcardiogram (VCG) representing magnitude and direction of electrical vectors during cardiac depolarization and repolarization.
                        Transformed coordinates may include one or more a Cartesian coordinate system (x, y, z), polar coordinate system (r, θ), cylindrical
                        coordinate system (ρ, φ, z), or spherical coordinate system (r, θ, φ). In some cases, transformed coordinates may include
                        an angle, such as with polar coordinates, cylindrical coordinates, and spherical coordinates. In some cases, VCG may be normalized
                        thus permitting full representation with only angles, i.e., angle traversals. In some cases, angle traversals may be advantageously
                        processed with one or more processes, such as those described below and/or spectral analysis.

For example, and without limitation, fixed background image 124 may contain a predefined border on fixed background image 124 wherein primary image 140 should be placed within the predefined borders. Computing device 104 may identify the predefined border and determine that the information within the predefined border may be primary image 140.
                     
                  
               
            
         
         
         
            
               
                  
                           With continued reference to FIG. 1, computing device 104 may identify captured fixed background image 128 and captured primary image 144 within overlay image 120 using an image classifier. In one or more embodiments, processor 108 may be configured to perform image classification using an image classifier wherein processor 108 may be configured to detect various features of fixed background image 124 and/or primary image 140. An “image classifier,” as used in this disclosure is a machine-learning model, such as a mathematical model, neural net,
                        or program generated by a machine-learning algorithm known as a “classification algorithm,” as described in further detail
                        below, that sorts inputs of image information into categories or bins of data, outputting the categories or bins of data and/or
                        labels associated therewith. Image classifier may be configured to output at least a datum that labels or otherwise identifies
                        a set of images that are clustered together, found to be close under a distance metric as described below, or the like. Computing
                        device 104 and/or another device may generate image classifier using a classification algorithm, defined as a process whereby computing
                        device 104 derives a classifier from training data. Classification may be performed using, without limitation, linear classifiers such
                        as without limitation logistic regression and/or naive Bayes classifiers, nearest neighbor classifiers such as k-nearest neighbors
                        classifiers, support vector machines, least squares support vector machines, fisher's linear discriminant, quadratic classifiers,
                        decision trees, boosted trees, random forest classifiers, learning vector quantization, and/or neural network-based classifiers.
                        In some cases, processor 108 may use an image classifier to identify a key image in data described in any data described in this disclosure. As used herein,
                        a “key image” is an element of visual data used to identify and/or match elements to each other. An image classifier may be
                        trained with binarized visual data that has already been classified to determine key images in any other data described in
                        this disclosure. “Binarized visual data” for the purposes of this disclosure is visual data that is described in binary format.
                        For example, binarized visual data of a photo may be comprised of ones and zeroes wherein the specific sequence of ones and
                        zeros may be used to represent the photo. Binarized visual data may be used for image recognition wherein a specific sequence
                        of ones and zeroes may indicate a product present in the image. An image classifier may be consistent with any classifier
                        as discussed herein. An image classifier may receive input data (e.g. overlay image 120) described in this disclosure and output a key image with the data (e.g. field background image and/or primary image 140). In an embodiment, image classifier may be used to compare visual data in data such as overlay image 120 with visual data in another data set. Visual data in another data set may include a plurality of visual data retrieved from
                        database 116. In some cases, image classifier may identify one or more components within overlay image 120 that may be unique and/or that may belong to fixed background image 124. In one or more embodiments, processor 108 may employ pattern matching techniques to identify specific patterns or abnormalities within overlay image 120 in order to identify fixed background image 124 and/or primary image 140. This can involve comparing specific segments, intervals, patterns, color gamut, and the like. Cross-correlation, template
                        matching, or dynamic time warping algorithms may be used for this purpose. In one or more embodiments, computing device 104 and/or processor 108 may contain an existing digital image of fixed background image 124. In one or more embodiments, the existing digital image of fixed background image 124 may be compared to overlay image 120 wherein computing device 104 may compare various features within overlay image 120 and existing digital image of fixed background image 124. Similarly, computing device 104 may utilize known and repetitive features of primary image 140 in order to identify primary image 140. For example, and without limitation, while ECG signals may differ in two sets of primary images 140, the presence of X-Y coordinates, the presence of a graph in general and the like may be used to identify primary image 140. In one or more embodiments, computing device 104 may classify portions of overlay image 120 as depicting fixed background image 124 and/or primary image 140. In one or more embodiment pattern matching may include any classification processes as described in U.S. nonprovisional

                        the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference. In one or more embodiments, a machine learning model such as any
                        machine learning model as described in this disclosure may include a machine learning model as described in U.S. nonprovisional
                        application Ser. No. 18/652,364, filed on May 1, 2024, entitled “APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR TRAINING A MACHINE LEARNING MODEL

                           With continued reference to FIG. 1, computing device 104 is configured to compare captured fixed background image 128 to one or more image quality thresholds 168. An “image quality threshold” for the purposes of this disclosure is a parameter used to indicate the quality of an image
                        captured by input device 152. For example, and without limitation, image quality threshold 168 may include a particular contrast level wherein an image exceeding or failing to meet the particular contrast level may indicate
                        that the input device 152 failed to capture a proper image. In one or more embodiments, image quality thresholds 168 may include, loss of low contrast detail, the presence of visible spots or marks in overlay image 120, lens aberration on overlay image 120, color shifts, saturation shifts, white balance effectiveness, saturation of colors, lens distortion and the like. In an
                        embodiments, image quality threshold 168 may indicate the maximum saturation shift that may occur in overlay image 120 based on fixed background image 124. In one or more embodiments, image quality threshold 168 may indicate the limit as to how many colors may become unsaturated in color gamut. In one or more embodiments, image quality
                        threshold 168 may indicate the maximum range of exposure for overlay image 120 based on captured fixed background image 128 and the like. In one or more embodiments, computing device 104 may measure lighting uniformity, color moire, image noise, sharpness, exposure accuracy and ISO sensitivity, texture detail
                        and the like. In one or more embodiments, image quality threshold 168 may indicate the maximum lighting uniformity, color moire, image noise, sharpness, exposure accuracy and ISO sensitivity,
                        texture detail, if any. In one or more embodiments, image quality threshold 168 may be used to determine the quality of an image, such as overlay image 120, captured by input device 152. In one or more embodiments, the quality of an image may be measured by the perceived quality of fixed background image 124 within overlay image 120.
                     
                  
               
            
         
         
         
            
               
                  
                           With continued reference to FIG. 1, in one or more embodiments, computing device 104 may identify various features within overlay image 120 and/or fixed background image 124 such as color distortion, exposure accuracy and ISO sensitivity, texture detail and the like as described above and compare
                        said features to one or more image quality thresholds 168. In an embodiments, various image quality thresholds 168 may be binary. For example, and without limitation, image quality threshold 168 may indicate that any blemishes identified may indicate that the image has failed to satisfy one or more image quality thresholds
                        168. In one or more embodiments, image quality thresholds 168 may include a range of allowable to distortions to various shapes, patterns, grides and the like within fixed background
                        image 124. In one or more embodiments, image quality threshold 168 may indicate a maximum distortion which may be allowed to reference ECG signal, if any. In one or more embodiments, image
                        quality threshold 168 may indicate the maximum lens distortion, lighting uniformity, image noise and the like. In one or more embodiments, predetermined
                        patterns on fixed background image 124 may be used to determine if overlay image 120 satisfies one or more image quality thresholds 168. For example, and without limitation, changes in geometric patterns, changes in color gamut, changes in boxes and the like
                        may indicate satisfaction of one or more image quality thresholds 168. In one or more embodiments, patterns, geometric shapes and/or other markers on fixed background image 124 may further be used to determine the orientation of overlay image 120. In one or more embodiments, computing device 104 may determine an orientation of overlay image 120 by identifying markers within fixed background image 124 and identifying the orientation of the markers within captured fixed background image 128. In one or more embodiments, computing device 104 may measure the colors within overlay image 120 and compare them to known values that should be present within captured fixed background image 128. In one or more embodiments, computing device 104 may analyze the sharpness and/or clarity of various features on overlay image 120 and compare the sharpness and/or clarity to the actual sharpness and/or clarity of fixed background image 124. In one or more embodiments, computing device 104 may determine the range of contrast within overlay image 120 and compare that to actual values of fixed background image 124.
                     
                  
               
            
         
         
         
            
               
                  
                           In one or remove embodiments, comparing fixed background image 124 to one or more image quality thresholds may include generating a two dimensional matrix of a position of one to more geometric
                        patterns of captured fixed background image 128. In one or more embodiments, one or more edge detection and/or image detection techniques as described in this disclosure
                        (such as in reference to at least FIG. 2) may be used to identify geometric patterns on captured fixed background image and plot geometric patterns in a two dimensional
                        matrix. In one or more embodiments, two dimensional matrix may include a table of values indicating a position of one or more
                        geometric patterns and/or shapes on captured fixed background image. In one or more embodiments, image quality threshold may
                        include a two dimensional matrix of expected values of captured fixed background image 128. In one or more embodiments, image quality threshold 168 may include actual values of geometric patterns on fixed background image 124. In one or more embodiments, processor 108 may be configured to compare two dimensional matrix to image quality threshold. In one or more embodiments, a calculated
                        rotation matrix other than 1 between two dimensional matrix and image quality threshold may indicate a rotation in captured
                        fixed background image. In an embodiment, a skewing of values expected to be in a straight line within two dimensional matrix
                        may indicate warping or skewing of captured fixed background image. In one or more embodiments, variation in positions within
                        two dimensional matrix and image quality threshold 168 may indicate distortions. This may be explained in further detail in reference below in reference to at least FIG. 2.
                     
                  
               
            
         
         
         
            
               
                  
                           With continued reference to FIG. 1, in one or more embodiments, image quality thresholds 168 may be generated based on known and actual values associated with fixed background images 124. For example, and without limitation, fixed background image 124 may contain known noise levels, known contrast levels, known geometric distributions wherein variations within overlay image
                        120 may indicate that the input device 152 did not properly capture or scan fixed background image 124. In one or more embodiments, fixed background image 124 may be generated and/or input by an individual associated with apparatus 100. In one or more embodiments, fixed background image 124 may come with an associated table of values indicating the various known parameters of fixed background image 124. In one or more embodiments, an individual associated with apparatus 100 may input image quality thresholds 168 and a range associated therewith for use by computing device 104. In one or more embodiments, computing device 104 may measure various parameters of overlay image 120 and compare said parameters to one or more image quality thresholds 168. In one or more embodiments, variations within the captured fixed background image 128 and fixed background image 124 may indicate issues with the input device 152 or the capturing process.
                     
                  
               
            
         
         
         
            
               
                  
                           In one or more embodiments, fixed background image 124 may contain an associated fixed reference image 172. A “fixed reference image” for the purposes of this disclosure is a digital copy of fixed background image 124. In one or more embodiments, fixed reference image 172 may be digitally generated. In one or more embodiments, fixed reference image 172 may include a digital replica or copy of fixed background image 124. In one or more embodiments, fixed reference image 172 may be used to print or produce fixed background image 124. In one or more embodiments, processor 108 may be configured to compare overlay image 120 and/or captured fixed background image 128 and compare various parameters of captured fixed background image 128 to fixed reference image 172. In one or more embodiments, changes in color saturation, changes in distortion, changes in contrast and the like may indicate
                        poor capture quality by input device 152. In one or more embodiments, comparing captured fixed background image 128 to one or more image quality thresholds 168 may include comparing captured fixed background image 128 to fixed reference image 172. In one or more embodiments, captured fixed background image 128 within overlay image 120 may be compared to fixed reference image 172. In one or more embodiments, fixed reference image 172 may be generated by an individual associated with apparatus 100, received from a 3rd party, retrieved from a database 116 and the like.
                     
                  
               
            
         
         
         
            
               
                  
                           With continued reference to FIG. 1, computing device 104 is configured to determine an image quality score 176. An “image quality score” for the purposes of this disclosure is a determination as to whether overlay image 120, or the contents captured therein, are suitable for use. For example, and without limitation, image quality score 176 may indicate that overlay image 120 contains poor image quality, and as a result, the contents therein (e.g. primary image 140) cannot be used for further processing. In one or more embodiments, image quality score 176 may be determined by the comparison of overlay image 120 and/or captured fixed background image 128 to one or more image quality thresholds 168. In one or more embodiments, image quality score 176 may be binary wherein image quality score 176 may indicate if overlay image 120, and the contents there are suitable for use. In one or more embodiments, image quality score 176 may be numerical wherein image quality score 176 may be calculated based on adherence of fixed background image 124, or alternatively overlay image 120, to one or more image quality thresholds 168. In one or more embodiments, a determination of the quality of fixed background image 124 within overlay image 120 may be used as a determination of the quality of primary image 140. In one or more embodiments, processor 108 may determine image quality score 176 of captured primary image 144 as a function of captured fixed background image 128 and/or captured fixed background image 128 within overlay image 120. In one or more embodiments, image quality score 176 may be used to determine if captured primary image 144 may be suitable for use by computing device 104. In one or more embodiments, captured primary image 144 may be suitable for further processing by computing device 104. In one or more embodiments, variations in captured fixed background image 128 may be indicative of variations within captured primary image 144.
                     
                  
               
            
         
         
         
            
               
                  
                           With continued reference to FIG. 1, processor 108 is configured to output an image modification datum 180 as a function of at least image quality score 176. An “image modification datum” for the purposes of this disclosure is information that can be used to increase the quality
                        of overlay image 120. For example and without limitation image modification datum 180 may include instructions to reduce lighting on light source 164, to change the angle of imaging device 156 positioned at primary image 140 and the like. In one or more embodiments, image modification datum 180 may be used to modify one or more components within input device 152 in order to capture a better image of overlay image 120. In one or more embodiments, image modification datum 180 may include steps and/or instructions, such as but not limited to, instructions to increase light intensity, decrease light
                        intensity, increase light warmth, change the angle of imaging device 156, change the aperture of imaging device 156 and the like. In one or more embodiments, image modification datum 180 may include information indicating that a blemish, crease and/or a dust particle was identified on fixed background image
                        124 and as a result, needs to be removed. In one or more embodiments, image modification datum 180 may further include steps and/or instructions needed to digitally modify overlay image 120 in order for overlay image 120 to receive a higher and/or valid image quality score 176. In one or more embodiments, image modification datum 180 may include instructions in order to digitally alter overlay image 120 such as but not limited to, changing the contrast of overlay image 120, changing the brightness, changing the exposure, changing highlights, changing the warmth, changing the sharpness and the
                        like. In one or more embodiments, image modification datum 180 may include one or more instructions in order for overlay image 120 and/or captured fixed background image 128 to satisfy one or more image thresholds. In one or more embodiments, image modification datum may be determined by changes
                        in two dimensional matrix in comparison to image quality thresholds 168 and/or expected values. In an embodiments, changes in two dimensional matrix may be correlated with a degree of change for
                        one or more parameters of imaging device. for example, and without limitation, values in a rotation matrix may indicate the
                        amount of rotation needed to fix imaging device. In another non-limiting example, changes in the positioning of geometric
                        patterns may indicate a relative degree of change needed for fixing distortion of imaging device.
                     
                  
               
            
         
         
         
            
               
                  
                           With continued reference to FIG. 1, image modification datum 180 may further include image modification parameters 184 for input device 152. “Image modification parameters” for the purposes of this disclosure is information associated with the configurable settings
                        186 of input device 152. For example, and without limitation image modification parameter 184 may refer to the aperture level on input device 152 wherein the aperture level may be configured to allow for the increase or decrease of light. In one or more embodiments,
                        image modification parameter 184 may include instructions and commands to modify at least one configurable setting 186 on input device 152. A “configurable setting” for the purposes of this disclosure is an option within a device or system that can be adjusted
                        in order to alter how the system or device behaves or performs. For example, and without limitation, configurable setting
                        186 may include aperture levels, light intensity, light warmth, resolution and the like. In an embodiments, each configurable
                        setting 186 of input device 152 may affect the quality of overlay image 120. In an embodiments, modification of each or any configurable setting 186 on input device 152 may affect the resulting product (e.g. overlay image 120).

                           In one or more embodiments, image modification parameters 184 may be generated as a function of the one or more image quality thresholds 168. In an embodiments, failure to satisfy a particular image quality threshold 168 may indicate a particular image modification parameter 184. For example, and without limitation, in instances overlay image 120 fails to satisfy an image quality threshold 168 associated with brightness, image modification parameter 184 may include instructions to adjust brightness. In one or more embodiments, various parameters within overlay image 120 may be quantified wherein failing to meet or exceeding a particular threshold may be directly related and proportional to
                        a particular image modification parameter 184. For example, and without limitation, failing to meet a brightness standard by a numerical value of 10 may indicate to computing
                        device 104 to increase or decrease the light intensity of light source 164 by a particular amount. In one or more embodiments, image modification parameters 184 may be directly proportional and/or linearly associated with image quality thresholds 168. In one or more embodiments, larger deviations from image quality thresholds 168 may result in larger deviations in image modification parameters 184.
                     
                  
               
            
         
         
         
            
               
                  
                           With continued reference to FIG. 1, image modification datum 180 may be linearly and/or proportionally related to deviations in image quality thresholds 168. In an embodiment failure to satisfy a particular image quality threshold 168 may result in the generation or determination of image modification datum 180 while the intensity of the deviation from the image quality threshold 168 may indicate the intensity of the image modification datum 180. In one or more embodiments, an individual associated with apparatus 100 may populate a table having a plurality of image modification datum 180 wherein each image modification datum 180 is associated with a particular image quality threshold 168. In one or more embodiments, failure to satisfy a particular image quality threshold 168 may result in the generation or selection of the associated image modification datum 180. In one or more embodiments, image modification datum 180 may contain variables that adjust accordingly based on the deviation from an image quality threshold 168. In an embodiment, a larger deviation from a particular image quality threshold 168 may result in a larger intensity of a particular image modification datum 180. For example, and without limitation, an image modification datum 180 may indicate to increase brightness by +10 or +50 depending on the deviation of a particular image quality threshold 168.
                     
                  
               
            
         
         
         
            
               
                  
                           With continued reference to FIG. 1, image modification datum 180 may be generated as a function of a machine learning model. In one or more embodiments, computing device 104 may include a machine learning module to implement one or more algorithms or generate one or more machine-learning models
                        to generate outputs. However, the machine learning module is exemplary and may not be necessary to generate one or more machine
                        learning models and perform any machine learning described herein. In one or more embodiments, one or more machine-learning
                        models may be generated using training data. Training data may include inputs and corresponding predetermined outputs so that
                        a machine-learning model may use correlations between the provided exemplary inputs and outputs to develop an algorithm and/or
                        relationship that then allows machine-learning model to determine its own outputs for inputs. Training data may contain correlations
                        that a machine-learning process may use to model relationships between two or more categories of data elements. Exemplary
                        inputs and outputs may come from database 116, user inputs and/or be provided by a user. In other embodiments, a machine-learning module may obtain a training set by querying
                        a communicatively connected database 116 that includes past inputs and outputs. Training data may include inputs from various types of databases, resources, libraries,
                        dependencies and/or user inputs and outputs correlated to each of those inputs so that a machine-learning model may determine
                        an output. Correlations may indicate causative and/or predictive links between data, which may be modeled as relationships,
                        such as mathematical relationships, by machine-learning models, as described in further detail below. In one or more embodiments,
                        training data may be formatted and/or organized by categories of data elements by, for example, associating data elements
                        with one or more descriptors corresponding to categories of data elements. As a non-limiting example, training data may include
                        data entered in standardized forms by persons or processes, such that entry of a given data element in a given field in a
                        form may be mapped to one or more descriptors of categories. Elements in training data may be linked to categories by tags,
                        tokens, or other data elements. A machine learning module may be used to create a machine learning model and/or any other
                        machine learning model using training data. Training data may be data sets that have already been converted from raw data
                        whether manually, by machine, or any other method. In some cases, the machine learning model may be trained based on user
                        input. For example, a user may indicate that information that has been output is inaccurate wherein the machine learning model
                        may be trained as a function of the user input. In some cases, the machine learning model may allow for improvements to computing
                        device 104 such as but not limited to improvements relating to comparing data items, the ability to sort efficiently, an increase in
                        accuracy of analytical methods and the like.

                        between two or more categories of data elements. The exemplary inputs and outputs may come from a database 116, and/or be provided by a user. In other embodiments, machine-learning module may obtain a training set by querying a communicatively
                        connected database 116 that includes past inputs and outputs. Training data may include inputs from various types of databases, resources, libraries,

                           In one or more embodiments, a machine learning model such as modification machine learning model 188 may contain parameter values. “Parameter values” for the purposes of this disclosure are internal variables that a machine
                        learning model has generated from training data in order to make predictions. In one or more embodiments, parameter values
                        may be adjusted during pretraining or training in order to minimize a loss function. In one or more embodiments, during training,
                        predicted outputs of the machine learning model are compared to actual outputs wherein the discrepancy between predicted output
                        and actual outputs are measured in order to minimize a loss function. A loss function also known an “error function” may measure
                        the difference between predicted outputs and actual outputs in order to improve the performance of the machine learning model.
                        A loss function may quantify the error margin between a predicted output and an actual output wherein the error margin may
                        be sought to be minimized during the training process. The loss function may allow for minimization of discrepancies between
                        predicted outputs and actual outputs of the machine learning model. In one or more embodiments, the loss function may adjust
                        parameter values of the machine learning model. In one or more embodiments, in a linear regression model, parameter values
                        may include coefficients assigned to each feature and the bias term. In one or more embodiments, in a neural network, parameter
                        values may include weights and biases associated with the connection between neurons or nodes within layers of the network.
                        In one or more embodiments, during pretraining and/or training of the machine learning model, parameter values of the machine
                        learning model (e.g. modification machine learning model 188) may be adjusted as a function of at least one output of the machine learning model. In one or more embodiments, processor

Additionally or alternatively, computing device 104 may instruct a user of apparatus 100 to adjust various configurable settings 186 of input device 152 prior to capture of updated overlay image 192. In one or more embodiments, overlay image 120 may be digitally modified wherein updated overlay image 192 may include modification made to overlay image 120. This may include, but is not limited to, changes to contrast, changes to brightness, changes to exposure levels and the
                        like. In one or more embodiments, computing device 104 may use an image modification software to modify parameters of overlay image 120 to generate updated overlay image 192. In one or more embodiments, updated overlay image 192 may include an updated fixed background image 194 and an updated primary image 196.

In one or more embodiments, updated quality score may be used to train modification machine learning model
                        188. In an embodiments, updated image quality score 198 may serve as feedback to modification machine learning model 188 wherein positive changes to updated image quality in comparison to image quality score 176 may indicate accurate outputs, while negative changes to updated image quality score 198 in comparison to image quality score 176 may indicate inaccurate outputs. In one or more embodiments, updated image quality score 198 may be used to modify parameter values of modification machine learning model 188 such that outputs are more accurate in future iterations. In one or more embodiments, modification machine learning model
                        188 may be self-supervised wherein the accuracy of outputs may be determined using updated image quality score 198.
                     
                  
               
            
         
         
         
            
               
                  
                           With continued reference to FIG. 1, primary image 140 may be used within one or more machine learning models to make one or more determinations about a patient. In an embodiment,
                        primary image 140 and/or captured primary image 144 may indicate various cardiac abnormalities associated with a patient wherein modifications and/or distortions to primary
                        image 140 may yield inaccurate outputs. In one or more embodiments, image quality score 176 and/or image modification datum 180 may minimize the amount of inaccurate outputs. In one or more embodiments, computing device 104 may determine the quality of captured fixed background image 128 and make one or more determinations on captured primary image 144. In one or more embodiments, captured primary image 144 may be used to train one or more machine learning models. In one or more embodiments, a plurality of captured primary images
                        144 may be created wherein the plurality of captured primary images 144 may be used as training data in one or more machine learning models.

                           Referring now to FIG. 2, an exemplary embodiment of a fixed background image 200 is described. In one or more embodiments, fixed background image 200 may serve as a test sheet in order to determine the quality of a photograph or a scan captured by an imaging device. In one
                        or more embodiment, fixed background image 200 may allow computing device and/or an individual to determine if a photo was captured with proper lighting, with proper contrast,
                        with proper color output and the like. In one or more embodiments, fixed background image 200 may include a color gamut 204 which may be used to determine if the color output of a captured image has been captured correctly. In one or more embodiments,
                        fixed background image 200 may include geometric patterns 208. In one or more embodiments, geometric patterns may be used to determine if distortion has occurred if contrast has been
                        distorted and the like. In one or more embodiments, the geometric patterns may be used to figure out the intrinsic (focal
                        length, optical center) and extrinsic parameters of an imaging device (e.g. rotation and translation of the camera) as well
                        as distortion caused due to paper or lens used. In one or more embodiments, an imaging device may capture a test sheet, such
                        as fixed background image and identify corners of geometric patterns such as black and white squares. In one or more embodiments,
                        identifying corners allows the computing device to identify the positions of the black and white squares. These positions
                        may then be compared to the actual positions of the geometric patterns on fixed background image 200. In one or more embodiments, comparison between actual and identified positions of geometric patterns using optimization
                        techniques such as Levenberg-Marquardt algorithms can be used to determine the imaging device's focal length, optical center,
                        distortion coefficients, rotation and the like. In one or more embodiments, processor 108 may use one or more machine vision systems in order to identify geometric patterns and/or colors in fixed background image
                        200. For example, in some cases a machine vision system may be used for world modeling or registration of objects within a space
                        such as fixed background image 200. In some cases, registration may include image processing, such as without limitation object recognition, feature detection,
                        edge/corner detection, and the like. Non-limiting example of feature detection may include scale invariant feature transform
                        (SIFT), Canny edge detection, Shi Tomasi corner detection, and the like. In some cases, registration may include one or more
                        transformations to orient a camera frame (or an image or video stream) relative a three-dimensional coordinate system; exemplary
                        transformations include without limitation homography transforms and affine transforms. In an embodiment, registration of
                        first frame to a coordinate system may be verified and/or corrected using object identification and/or computer vision, as
                        described above. For instance, and without limitation, an initial registration to two dimensions, represented for instance
                        as registration to the x and y coordinates, may be performed using a two-dimensional projection of points in three dimensions
                        onto a first frame, however. A third dimension of registration, representing depth and/or a z axis, may be detected by comparison
                        of two frames; for instance, where first frame includes a pair of frames captured using a pair of cameras (e.g., stereoscopic
                        camera also referred to in this disclosure as stereo-camera), image recognition and/or edge detection software may be used
                        to detect a pair of stereoscopic views of images of an object; two stereoscopic views may be compared to derive z-axis values
                        of points on object permitting, for instance, derivation of further z-axis points within and/or around the object using interpolation.
                        This may be repeated with multiple objects in field of view, including without limitation environmental features of interest
                        identified by object classifier and/or indicated by an operator. In an embodiment, x and y axes may be chosen to span a plane
                        common to two cameras used for stereoscopic image capturing and/or an xy plane of a first frame; a result, x and y translational
                        components and ø may be pre-populated in translational and rotational matrices, for affine transformation of coordinates of
                        object, also as described above. Initial x and y coordinates and/or guesses at transformational matrices may alternatively
                        or additionally be performed between first frame and second frame, as described above. For each point of a plurality of points
                        on object and/or edge and/or edges of object as described above, x and y coordinates of a first stereoscopic frame may be
                        populated, with an initial estimate of z coordinates based, for instance, on assumptions about object, such as an assumption
                        that ground is substantially parallel to an xy plane as selected above. Z coordinates, and/or x, y, and z coordinates, registered
                        using image capturing and/or object identification processes as described above may then be compared to coordinates predicted
                        using initial guess at transformation matrices; an error function may be computed using by comparing the two sets of points,
                        and new x, y, and/or z coordinates, may be iteratively estimated and compared until the error function drops below a threshold
                        level. In some cases, a machine vision system may use a classifier, such as any classifier described throughout this disclosure.
                        In one or more embodiments, processor 108 may be configured to determine focal length by using known sizes and structures of geometric patterns and how they are projected
                        onto an image. In one or more embodiments, processor may compute distortion coefficients by identifying deviations in patterns
                        on fixed background image in comparison to their expected positions. In one or more embodiments, distortion coefficients may
                        include radial distortion which account for barrel r pincushion distortion wherein points are displaced radially from a center.
                        In one or more embodiments, distortion coefficients may include tangential coefficients in which lens misalignment may include
                        points to be displaced tangentially. In one or more embodiments, one or more edge detection algorithms as described above
                        may be used to identify the locations of various geometric patterns. In one or more embodiments, processor may use one or
                        more edge detection techniques to identify grids, patterns and the like within fixed background image. In one or more embodiments,
                        processor may define corresponding points for each pattern on fixed background image based on their relative position on fixed
                        background image. In one or more embodiments, processor may generate a matrix of points wherein changes in the matrix to expected
                        values in order to determine focal length, distortion coefficients and the like.
                     
                  
               
            
         
         
         
            
               
                  
                           With continued reference to FIG. 1, features on fixed background image 200 such as corners or dots across multiple geometric patterns may be used to determine focal length. In one or more embodiments,
                        processor may use 3d coordinates of various features and their 2D projections in an image plane in order to determine focal
                        length. In one or more embodiments, optical center may be determined by finding a point in an image plan in which the optical
                        axis intersects. This may be done by minimizing reprojection error for detected features. In one or more embodiments, distortion
                        coefficients may be determined by comparing the positions of various detect features on fixed background image to their expected
                        positions. Changes between actual and expected positions may indicate a distortion. In one or more embodiments, one or more
                        feature detection algorithms (e.g. edge detection) may be used to detect various features. In one or more embodiments, processor
                        may generate a 2D matrix of the detected features. In one or more embodiments, processor may be configured to compare the
                        actual matrix to an expected matric in order to find the rotation matrix which may be used to determine rotation of an imaging
                        device.
                     
                  
               
            
         
         
         
            
               
                  
                           With continued reference to FIG. 1, one or more edge detection techniques may be used in order to generate a two dimensional matrix of a position of geometric
                        features on fixed background image 200. In one or more embodiments, focal length may be determined by projecting three dimensional object points into a two dimensional
                        image plane and identifying variations between actual and expected values. In one or more embodiments, optical center may
                        be found by averaging projected image points on the matrix and minimizing reprojection error. In one or more embodiments,
                        distortion coefficients may be determined by determining a skew of various points within the two dimensional matrix. For example,
                        and without limitation, processor may identify points that should be in a straight line, yet the two dimensional matrix indicates
                        that the points are skewed. In one or more embodiments, rotation of imaging device by determining a rotation matrix between
                        actual values and expected values which two matrices. In one or more embodiments, brightness may be determined by calculating
                        the average intensity of all pixels within an image and comparing it to actual values. In one or more embodiments, contrast
                        may be determined by calculating a standard deviation of o pixel intensities and comparing them to known values. In one or
                        more embodiments, color correction may be determined by determining how much gain should be applied to presumably white pixel
                        in order to make them white.
                     
                  
               
            
         
         
         
            
               
                  
                           With continued reference to FIG. 1, in one or more embodiments, color gamut's on fixed background image may be used to correct deviations in known values on
                        fixed background image. In one or more embodiments, a computing device may compare captured colors on color gamut to actual
                        colors on color gamut. Deviations between actual colors and captured colors may indicate deviations in the settings of the
                        imaging device. In one or more embodiments, computing device may create a color profile in order to correct deviations and
                        ensure accurate color reproduction. In one or more embodiments, geometric patterns on fixed background image 200 may be used to detect points in fixed background image and compare the distance between points in the captured image and
                        the distance between points in fixed background image 200. In one or more embodiments, changes in the waves, distances, and the like of reference ECG signal 216 and a captured image of reference ECG signal 216 may contain that warping has occurred on the image. In one or more embodiments, fixed background image 200 may contain a demarcation 212. In one or more embodiments, the demarcation 212 may be used to instruct an individual as to where an image (such as primary image as described above) may be placed prior
                        to capture of fixed background image 200. In one or more embodiments, demarcation 212 may illustrate the borders on which an image or graphical illustration may be placed. In one or more embodiments, fixed background
                        image 200 may include an ECG reference Signal 216. In one or more embodiments, ECG reference signal 216 may include numbers, waves, and the like. In one or more embodiments, ECG reference signal 216 may be used to determine if distortions have occurred in an image of fixed background image 200. In one or more embodiments, changes in the curve, lengths, waves and the like of ECG reference signal 216 may indicate that information may not be properly extracted from the image.
                     
                  
               
            
         
         
         
            
               
                  
                           With continued reference to FIG. 2, various image quality check parameters may be used to ensure that an image captured of fixed background image is suitable
                        for processing. In one or more embodiments, a computing device may detect artifacts by analyzing the captured image for inconsistencies
                        or distortions in low contrast areas. Edge detection algorithms or comparison between the captured image with a reference
                        image may be used to identify any loss of detail. In one or more embodiments, detection of artifacts may indicate that the
                        compression settings or noise reduction settings on an imaging device require adjustment. In one or more embodiments, blemishes
                        may be identified within captured fixed background image by detecting irregularities or anomalies. Image processing algorithms
                        can be used to identify and classify these anomalies based on their size, shape, or intensity. In one or more embodiments,
                        the presence of blemishes may indicate the lens of the imaging device may be dirty. In one or more embodiments, color accuracy
                        can be determined by comparing the captured image with a reference color chart or color profile. Algorithms may analyze the
                        color values in the image and measure the differences between the captured colors and the expected colors. In one or more
                        embodiments, changes in color accuracy may indicate that the white balance settings or color calibration settings of imaging
                        device require adjustment. In one or more embodiments, lens distortion of imaging device may be identified by identifying
                        distortions within fixed background image 200. This may include identifying straight lines and/or known patterns and measuring deviations. In one or more embodiments,
                        correction of lens distortion may require using lenses with differing distortion characteristics. In one or more embodiments,
                        detecting of lens flare and/or light flickering may indicate the position, angle and/or lens used on imaging device may require
                        modification. In one or more embodiments, the use of anti-aliasing filters may be used to reduce or eliminate color moire
                        effects.
                     
                  
               
            
         
         
         
            
               
                  
                           Referring now to FIG. 3, an exemplary embodiment of an overlay image 300 is described. In one or more embodiments, overlay image may include an overlay image 300 as described in this disclosure. In one or more embodiments, overlay image 300 may include an image captured by an imaging device as described in this disclosure. In one or more embodiments, overlay image
                        may include an image of fixed background image 304. In one or more embodiments, overlay image may further include an image of primary image 308. In one or more embodiments, primary image may include a graphical illustration of ECG signals. In one or more embodiments,
                        primary image may include a printout of ECG signals received from an ECG machine. In one or more embodiments, a computing
                        device may receive overlay image 300 and determine if overlay image was captured properly. In one or more embodiments, a computing device as described above may
                        compare fixed background image 304 within overlay image 300 to image quality thresholds in order to determine the quality of overlay image 300. In one or more embodiments, in instances in which image of fixed background image 304 satisfies one or more image quality thresholds, image of primary image 308 may be determined to be suitable for use.
                     
                  
               
            
         
         
         
            
               
                  
                           Referring now to FIG. 4, a schematic 400 for capturing images is described. In one or more embodiments, schematic 400 may be used to capture overlay image as described above. In one or more embodiments, schematic may include the use of input
                        device as described above. In one or more embodiments, schematic may include the use of an imaging device 404, such as a camera. In one or more embodiments, schematic may include a light source 408. In one or more embodiments, light source may allow for the illumination of light onto an object that is sought to be captured.
                        In one or more embodiments, schematic 400 may further include a transparent panel 412. In one or more embodiments, transparent panel 412 may be configured to secure an object of interest in place. In one or more embodiments, the objects of interest may include
                        fixed background images and/or primary images.
                     
                  
               
            
         
         
         
            
               
                  
                           Referring now to FIG. 5, an exemplary embodiment of a machine-learning module 500 that may perform one or more machine-learning processes as described in this disclosure is illustrated. Machine-learning
                        module may perform determinations, classification, and/or analysis steps, methods, processes, or the like as described in
                        this disclosure using machine learning processes. A “machine learning process,” as used in this disclosure, is a process that
                        automatedly uses training data 504 to generate an algorithm instantiated in hardware or software logic, data structures, and/or functions that will be performed
                        by a computing device/module to produce outputs 508 given data provided as inputs 512; this is in contrast to a non-machine learning software program where the commands to be executed are determined in advance
                        by a user and written in a programming language.
                     
                  
               
            
         
         
         
            
               
                  
                           Still referring to FIG. 5, “training data,” as used herein, is data containing correlations that a machine-learning process may use to model relationships
                        between two or more categories of data elements. For instance, and without limitation, training data 504 may include a plurality of data entries, also known as “training examples,” each entry representing a set of data elements
                        that were recorded, received, and/or generated together; data elements may be correlated by shared existence in a given data
                        entry, by proximity in a given data entry, or the like. Multiple data entries in training data 504 may evince one or more trends in correlations between categories of data elements; for instance, and without limitation,
                        a higher value of a first data element belonging to a first category of data element may tend to correlate to a higher value
                        of a second data element belonging to a second category of data element, indicating a possible proportional or other mathematical
                        relationship linking values belonging to the two categories. Multiple categories of data elements may be related in training
                        data 504 according to various correlations; correlations may indicate causative and/or predictive links between categories of data
                        elements, which may be modeled as relationships such as mathematical relationships by machine-learning processes as described
                        in further detail below. Training data 504 may be formatted and/or organized by categories of data elements, for instance by associating data elements with one or more
                        descriptors corresponding to categories of data elements. As a non-limiting example, training data 504 may include data entered in standardized forms by persons or processes, such that entry of a given data element in a given
                        field in a form may be mapped to one or more descriptors of categories. Elements in training data 504 may be linked to descriptors of categories by tags, tokens, or other data elements; for instance, and without limitation,
                        training data 504 may be provided in fixed-length formats, formats linking positions of data to categories such as comma-separated value (CSV)
                        formats and/or self-describing formats such as extensible markup language (XML), JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), or the
                        like, enabling processes or devices to detect categories of data.
                     
                  
               
            
         
         
         
            
               
                  
                           Alternatively or additionally, and continuing to refer to FIG. 5, training data 504 may include one or more elements that are not categorized; that is, training data 504 may not be formatted or contain descriptors for some elements of data. Machine-learning algorithms and/or other processes
                        may sort training data 504 according to one or more categorizations using, for instance, natural language processing algorithms, tokenization, detection
                        of correlated values in raw data and the like; categories may be generated using correlation and/or other processing algorithms.
                        As a non-limiting example, in a corpus of text, phrases making up a number “n” of compound words, such as nouns modified by
                        other nouns, may be identified according to a statistically significant prevalence of n-grams containing such words in a particular
                        order; such an n-gram may be categorized as an element of language such as a “word” to be tracked similarly to single words,
                        generating a new category as a result of statistical analysis. Similarly, in a data entry including some textual data, a person's
                        name may be identified by reference to a list, dictionary, or other compendium of terms, permitting ad-hoc categorization
                        by machine-learning algorithms, and/or automated association of data in the data entry with descriptors or into a given format.
                        The ability to categorize data entries automatedly may enable the same training data 504 to be made applicable for two or more distinct machine-learning algorithms as described in further detail below. Training
                        data 504 used by machine-learning module 500 may correlate any input data as described in this disclosure to any output data as described in this disclosure. As a non-limiting
                        illustrative example inputs may include inputs such as image quality scores, overlay images and the like whereas outputs may
                        include outputs such as image modification datum.
                     
                  
               
            
         
         
         
            
               
                  
                           Further referring to FIG. 5, training data may be filtered, sorted, and/or selected using one or more supervised and/or unsupervised machine-learning
                        processes and/or models as described in further detail below; such models may include without limitation a training data classifier
                        516. Training data classifier 516 may include a “classifier,” which as used in this disclosure is a machine-learning model as defined below, such as a data
                        structure representing and/or using a mathematical model, neural net, or program generated by a machine learning algorithm
                        known as a “classification algorithm,” as described in further detail below, that sorts inputs into categories or bins of
                        data, outputting the categories or bins of data and/or labels associated therewith. A classifier may be configured to output
                        at least a datum that labels or otherwise identifies a set of data that are clustered together, found to be close under a
                        distance metric as described below, or the like. A distance metric may include any norm, such as, without limitation, a Pythagorean
                        norm. Machine-learning module 500 may generate a classifier using a classification algorithm, defined as a processes whereby a computing device and/or any
                        module and/or component operating thereon derives a classifier from training data 504. Classification may be performed using, without limitation, linear classifiers such as without limitation logistic regression
                        and/or naive Bayes classifiers, nearest neighbor classifiers such as k-nearest neighbors classifiers, support vector machines,
                        least squares support vector machines, fisher's linear discriminant, quadratic classifiers, decision trees, boosted trees,
                        random forest classifiers, learning vector quantization, and/or neural network-based classifiers. As a non-limiting example,
                        training data classifier 516 may classify elements of training data to classes associated with image quality thresholds. For example, and without limitation,
                        elements may be classified to classes of images having low brightness, classes of images having high contrast and the like.
                     
                  
               
            
         
         
         
            
               
                  
                           Still referring to FIG. 5, Computing device may be configured to generate a classifier using a Naïve Bayes classification algorithm. Naïve Bayes classification
                        algorithm generates classifiers by assigning class labels to problem instances, represented as vectors of element values.
                        Class labels are drawn from a finite set. Naïve Bayes classification algorithm may include generating a family of algorithms
                        that assume that the value of a particular element is independent of the value of any other element, given a class variable.
                        Naïve Bayes classification algorithm may be based on Bayes Theorem expressed as P(A/B)=P(B/A)P(A)÷P(B), where P(A/B) is the
                        probability of hypothesis A given data B also known as posterior probability; P(B/A) is the probability of data B given that
                        the hypothesis A was true; P(A) is the probability of hypothesis A being true regardless of data also known as prior probability
                        of A; and P(B) is the probability of the data regardless of the hypothesis. A naïve Bayes algorithm may be generated by first
                        transforming training data into a frequency table. Computing device may then calculate a likelihood table by calculating probabilities
                        of different data entries and classification labels. Computing device may utilize a naïve Bayes equation to calculate a posterior
                        probability for each class. A class containing the highest posterior probability is the outcome of prediction. Naïve Bayes
                        classification algorithm may include a gaussian model that follows a normal distribution. Naïve Bayes classification algorithm
                        may include a multinomial model that is used for discrete counts. Naïve Bayes classification algorithm may include a Bernoulli
                        model that may be utilized when vectors are binary.
                     
                  
               
            
         
         
         
            
               
                  
                           With continued reference to FIG. 5, Computing device may be configured to generate a classifier using a K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm. A “K-nearest neighbors
                        algorithm” as used in this disclosure, includes a classification method that utilizes feature similarity to analyze how closely
                        out-of-sample-features resemble training data to classify input data to one or more clusters and/or categories of features
                        as represented in training data; this may be performed by representing both training data and input data in vector forms,
                        and using one or more measures of vector similarity to identify classifications within training data, and to determine a classification
                        of input data. K-nearest neighbors algorithm may include specifying a K-value, or a number directing the classifier to select
                        the k most similar entries training data to a given sample, determining the most common classifier of the entries in the database,
                        and classifying the known sample; this may be performed recursively and/or iteratively to generate a classifier that may be
                        used to classify input data as further samples. For instance, an initial set of samples may be performed to cover an initial
                        heuristic and/or “first guess” at an output and/or relationship, which may be seeded, without limitation, using expert input
                        received according to any process as described herein. As a non-limiting example, an initial heuristic may include a ranking
                        of associations between inputs and elements of training data. Heuristic may include selecting some number of highest-ranking
                        associations and/or training data elements.
                     
                  
               
            
         
         
         
            
               
                  
                           With continued reference to FIG. 5, generating k-nearest neighbors algorithm may generate a first vector output containing a data entry cluster, generating
                        a second vector output containing an input data, and calculate the distance between the first vector output and the second
                        vector output using any suitable norm such as cosine similarity, Euclidean distance measurement, or the like. Each vector
                        output may be represented, without limitation, as an n-tuple of values, where n is at least two values. Each value of n-tuple
                        of values may represent a measurement or other quantitative value associated with a given category of data, or attribute,
                        examples of which are provided in further detail below; a vector may be represented, without limitation, in n-dimensional
                        space using an axis per category of value represented in n-tuple of values, such that a vector has a geometric direction characterizing
                        the relative quantities of attributes in the n-tuple as compared to each other. Two vectors may be considered equivalent where
                        their directions, and/or the relative quantities of values within each vector as compared to each other, are the same; thus,
                        as a non-limiting example, a vector represented as [5, 10, 15] may be treated as equivalent, for purposes of this disclosure,
                        as a vector represented as [1, 2, 3]. Vectors may be more similar where their directions are more similar, and more different
                        where their directions are more divergent; however, vector similarity may alternatively or additionally be determined using
                        averages of similarities between like attributes, or any other measure of similarity suitable for any n-tuple of values, or
                        aggregation of numerical similarity measures for the purposes of loss functions as described in further detail below. Any
                        vectors as described herein may be scaled, such that each vector represents each attribute along an equivalent scale of values.
                        Each vector may be “normalized,” or divided by a “length” attribute, such as a length attribute l as derived using a Pythagorean
                        norm:
                     
                  
               
            
         
         
         
            
               
                  
                           
                        
(NB)

                        
                        where ai is attribute number i of the vector. Scaling and/or normalization may function to make vector comparison independent of absolute
                        quantities of attributes, while preserving any dependency on similarity of attributes; this may, for instance, be advantageous
                        where cases represented in training data are represented by different quantities of samples, which may result in proportionally
                        equivalent vectors with divergent values.
                        
                     
                  
               
            
         
         
         
            
               
                  
                           With further reference to FIG. 5, training examples for use as training data may be selected from a population of potential examples according to cohorts
                        relevant to an analytical problem to be solved, a classification task, or the like. Alternatively or additionally, training
                        data may be selected to span a set of likely circumstances or inputs for a machine-learning model and/or process to encounter
                        when deployed. For instance, and without limitation, for each category of input data to a machine-learning process or model
                        that may exist in a range of values in a population of phenomena such as images, user data, process data, physical data, or
                        the like, a computing device, processor, and/or machine-learning model may select training examples representing each possible
                        value on such a range and/or a representative sample of values on such a range. Selection of a representative sample may include
                        selection of training examples in proportions matching a statistically determined and/or predicted distribution of such values
                        according to relative frequency, such that, for instance, values encountered more frequently in a population of data so analyzed
                        are represented by more training examples than values that are encountered less frequently. Alternatively or additionally,
                        a set of training examples may be compared to a collection of representative values in a database and/or presented to a user,
                        so that a process can detect, automatically or via user input, one or more values that are not included in the set of training
                        examples. Computing device, processor, and/or module may automatically generate a missing training example; this may be done
                        by receiving and/or retrieving a missing input and/or output value and correlating the missing input and/or output value with
                        a corresponding output and/or input value collocated in a data record with the retrieved value, provided by a user and/or
                        other device, or the like.
                     
                  
               
            
         
         
         
            
               
                  
                           Continuing to refer to FIG. 5, computer, processor, and/or module may be configured to preprocess training data. “Preprocessing” training data, as used
                        in this disclosure, is transforming training data from raw form to a format that can be used for training a machine learning
                        model. Preprocessing may include sanitizing, feature selection, feature scaling, data augmentation and the like.
                     
                  
               
            
         
         
         
            
               
                  
                           Still referring to FIG. 5, computer, processor, and/or module may be configured to sanitize training data. “Sanitizing” training data, as used in this
                        disclosure, is a process whereby training examples are removed that interfere with convergence of a machine-learning model
                        and/or process to a useful result. For instance, and without limitation, a training example may include an input and/or output
                        value that is an outlier from typically encountered values, such that a machine-learning algorithm using the training example
                        will be adapted to an unlikely amount as an input and/or output; a value that is more than a threshold number of standard
                        deviations away from an average, mean, or expected value, for instance, may be eliminated. Alternatively or additionally,
                        one or more training examples may be identified as having poor quality data, where “poor quality” is defined as having a signal
                        to noise ratio below a threshold value. Sanitizing may include steps such as removing duplicative or otherwise redundant data,
                        interpolating missing data, correcting data errors, standardizing data, identifying outliers, and the like. In a nonlimiting
                        example, sanitization may include utilizing algorithms for identifying duplicate entries or spell-check algorithms.
                     
                  
               
            
         
         
         
            
               
                  
                           As a non-limiting example, and with further reference to FIG. 5, images used to train an image classifier or other machine-learning model and/or process that takes images as inputs or generates
                        images as outputs may be rejected if image quality is below a threshold value. For instance, and without limitation, computing
                        device, processor, and/or module may perform blur detection, and eliminate one or more Blur detection may be performed, as
                        a non-limiting example, by taking Fourier transform, or an approximation such as a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of the image
                        and analyzing a distribution of low and high frequencies in the resulting frequency-domain depiction of the image; numbers
                        of high-frequency values below a threshold level may indicate blurriness. As a further non-limiting example, detection of
                        blurriness may be performed by convolving an image, a channel of an image, or the like with a Laplacian kernel; this may generate
                        a numerical score reflecting a number of rapid changes in intensity shown in the image, such that a high score indicates clarity
                        and a low score indicates blurriness. Blurriness detection may be performed using a gradient-based operator, which measures
                        operators based on the gradient or first derivative of an image, based on the hypothesis that rapid changes indicate sharp
                        edges in the image, and thus are indicative of a lower degree of blurriness. Blur detection may be performed using Wavelet-based
                        operator, which takes advantage of the capability of coefficients of the discrete wavelet transform to describe the frequency
                        and spatial content of images. Blur detection may be performed using statistics-based operators take advantage of several
                        image statistics as texture descriptors in order to compute a focus level. Blur detection may be performed by using discrete
                        cosine transform (DCT) coefficients in order to compute a focus level of an image from its frequency content.
                     
                  
               
            
         
         
         
            
               
                  
                           Continuing to refer to FIG. 5, computing device, processor, and/or module may be configured to precondition one or more training examples. For instance,
                        and without limitation, where a machine learning model and/or process has one or more inputs and/or outputs requiring, transmitting,
                        or receiving a certain number of bits, samples, or other units of data, one or more training examples' elements to be used
                        as or compared to inputs and/or outputs may be modified to have such a number of units of data. For instance, a computing
                        device, processor, and/or module may convert a smaller number of units, such as in a low pixel count image, into a desired
                        number of units, for instance by upsampling and interpolating. As a non-limiting example, a low pixel count image may have
                        100 pixels, however a desired number of pixels may be 128. Processor may interpolate the low pixel count image to convert
                        the 100 pixels into 128 pixels. It should also be noted that one of ordinary skill in the art, upon reading this disclosure,
                        would know the various methods to interpolate a smaller number of data units such as samples, pixels, bits, or the like to
                        a desired number of such units. In some instances, a set of interpolation rules may be trained by sets of highly detailed
                        inputs and/or outputs and corresponding inputs and/or outputs downsampled to smaller numbers of units, and a neural network
                        or other machine learning model that is trained to predict interpolated pixel values using the training data. As a non-limiting
                        example, a sample input and/or output, such as a sample picture, with sample-expanded data units (e.g., pixels added between
                        the original pixels) may be input to a neural network or machine-learning model and output a pseudo replica sample-picture
                        with dummy values assigned to pixels between the original pixels based on a set of interpolation rules. As a non-limiting
                        example, in the context of an image classifier, a machine-learning model may have a set of interpolation rules trained by
                        sets of highly detailed images and images that have been downsampled to smaller numbers of pixels, and a neural network or
                        other machine learning model that is trained using those examples to predict interpolated pixel values in a facial picture
                        context. As a result, an input with sample-expanded data units (the ones added between the original data units, with dummy
                        values) may be run through a trained neural network and/or model, which may fill in values to replace the dummy values. Alternatively
                        or additionally, processor, computing device, and/or module may utilize sample expander methods, a low-pass filter, or both.
                        As used in this disclosure, a “low-pass filter” is a filter that passes signals with a frequency lower than a selected cutoff
                        frequency and attenuates signals with frequencies higher than the cutoff frequency. The exact frequency response of the filter
                        depends on the filter design. Computing device, processor, and/or module may use averaging, such as luma or chroma averaging
                        in images, to fill in data units in between original data units.
                     
                  
               
            
         
         
         
            
               
                  
                           In some embodiments, and with continued reference to FIG. 5, computing device, processor, and/or module may down-sample elements of a training example to a desired lower number of data
                        elements. As a non-limiting example, a high pixel count image may have 256 pixels, however a desired number of pixels may
                        be 128. Processor may down-sample the high pixel count image to convert the 256 pixels into 128 pixels. In some embodiments,
                        processor may be configured to perform downsampling on data. Downsampling, also known as decimation, may include removing
                        every Nth entry in a sequence of samples, all but every Nth entry, or the like, which is a process known as “compression,”
                        and may be performed, for instance by an N-sample compressor implemented using hardware or software. Anti-aliasing and/or
                        anti-imaging filters, and/or low-pass filters, may be used to clean up side-effects of compression.
                     
                  
               
            
         
         
         
            
               
                  
                           Further referring to FIG. 5, feature selection includes narrowing and/or filtering training data to exclude features and/or elements, or training data
                        including such elements, that are not relevant to a purpose for which a trained machine-learning model and/or algorithm is
                        being trained, and/or collection of features and/or elements, or training data including such elements, on the basis of relevance
                        or utility for an intended task or purpose for a trained machine-learning model and/or algorithm is being trained. Feature
                        selection may be implemented, without limitation, using any process described in this disclosure, including without limitation
                        using training data classifiers, exclusion of outliers, or the like.
                     
                  
               
            
         
         
         
            
               
                  
                           With continued reference to FIG. 5, feature scaling may include, without limitation, normalization of data entries, which may be accomplished by dividing numerical
                        fields by norms thereof, for instance as performed for vector normalization. Feature scaling may include absolute maximum
                        scaling, wherein each quantitative datum is divided by the maximum absolute value of all quantitative data of a set or subset
                        of quantitative data. Feature scaling may include min-max scaling, in which each value X has a minimum value Xmin in a set or subset of values subtracted therefrom, with the result divided by the range of the values, give maximum value
                        in the set or subset
                     
                  
               
            
         
         
         
            
               
                  
                           
                        
(NB)

                        
                        Feature scaling may include mean normalization, which involves use of a mean value of a set and/or subset of values, Xmean with maximum and minimum values:
                        
                     
                  
               
            
         
         
         
            
               
                  
                           
                        
(NB)

                        
                        Feature scaling may include standardization, where a difference between X and Xmean is divided by a standard deviation σ of a set or subset of values:
                        
                     
                  
               
            
         
         
         
            
               
                  
                           
                        
(NB)

                        
                        Scaling may be performed using a median value of a a set or subset Xmedian and/or interquartile range (IQR), which represents the difference between the 25th percentile value and the 50th percentile value (or closest values thereto by a rounding protocol), such as:
                        
                     
                  
               
            
         
         
         
            
               
                  
                           
                        
(NB)

                        
                        Persons skilled in the art, upon reviewing the entirety of this disclosure, will be aware of various alternative or additional
                        approaches that may be used for feature scaling.
                        
                     
                  
               
            
         
         
         
            
               
                  
                           Further referring to FIG. 5, computing device, processor, and/or module may be configured to perform one or more processes of data augmentation. “Data
                        augmentation” as used in this disclosure is addition of data to a training set using elements and/or entries already in the
                        dataset. Data augmentation may be accomplished, without limitation, using interpolation, generation of modified copies of
                        existing entries and/or examples, and/or one or more generative AI processes, for instance using deep neural networks and/or
                        generative adversarial networks; generative processes may be referred to alternatively in this context as “data synthesis”
                        and as creating “synthetic data.” Augmentation may include performing one or more transformations on data, such as geometric,
                        color space, affine, brightness, cropping, and/or contrast transformations of images.
                     
                  
               
            
         
         
         
            
               
                  
                           Still referring to FIG. 5, machine-learning module 500 may be configured to perform a lazy-learning process 520 and/or protocol, which may alternatively be referred to as a “lazy loading” or “call-when-needed” process and/or protocol,
                        may be a process whereby machine learning is conducted upon receipt of an input to be converted to an output, by combining
                        the input and training set to derive the algorithm to be used to produce the output on demand. For instance, an initial set
                        of simulations may be performed to cover an initial heuristic and/or “first guess” at an output and/or relationship. As a
                        non-limiting example, an initial heuristic may include a ranking of associations between inputs and elements of training data
                        504. Heuristic may include selecting some number of highest-ranking associations and/or training data 504 elements. Lazy learning may implement any suitable lazy learning algorithm, including without limitation a K-nearest neighbors
                        algorithm, a lazy naïve Bayes algorithm, or the like; persons skilled in the art, upon reviewing the entirety of this disclosure,
                        will be aware of various lazy-learning algorithms that may be applied to generate outputs as described in this disclosure,
                        including without limitation lazy learning applications of machine-learning algorithms as described in further detail below.
                     
                  
               
            
         
         
         
            
               
                  
                           Alternatively or additionally, and with continued reference to FIG. 5, machine-learning processes as described in this disclosure may be used to generate machine-learning models 524. A “machine-learning model,” as used in this disclosure, is a data structure representing and/or instantiating a mathematical
                        and/or algorithmic representation of a relationship between inputs and outputs, as generated using any machine-learning process
                        including without limitation any process as described above, and stored in memory; an input is submitted to a machine-learning
                        model 524 once created, which generates an output based on the relationship that was derived. For instance, and without limitation,
                        a linear regression model, generated using a linear regression algorithm, may compute a linear combination of input data using
                        coefficients derived during machine-learning processes to calculate an output datum. As a further non-limiting example, a
                        machine-learning model 524 may be generated by creating an artificial neural network, such as a convolutional neural network comprising an input layer
                        of nodes, one or more intermediate layers, and an output layer of nodes. Connections between nodes may be created via the
                        process of “training” the network, in which elements from a training data 504 set are applied to the input nodes, a suitable training algorithm (such as Levenberg-Marquardt, conjugate gradient, simulated
                        annealing, or other algorithms) is then used to adjust the connections and weights between nodes in adjacent layers of the
                        neural network to produce the desired values at the output nodes. This process is sometimes referred to as deep learning.
                     
                  
               
            
         
         
         
            
               
                  
                           Still referring to FIG. 5, machine-learning algorithms may include at least a supervised machine-learning process 528. At least a supervised machine-learning process 528, as defined herein, include algorithms that receive a training set relating a number of inputs to a number of outputs, and
                        seek to generate one or more data structures representing and/or instantiating one or more mathematical relations relating
                        inputs to outputs, where each of the one or more mathematical relations is optimal according to some criterion specified to
                        the algorithm using some scoring function. For instance, a supervised learning algorithm may include inputs such as overlay
                        images, updated overlay images, updated image quality scores, image quality scores and the like as described above as inputs,
                        image modification datum and/or updated image modification datum as outputs, and a scoring function representing a desired
                        form of relationship to be detected between inputs and outputs; scoring function may, for instance, seek to maximize the probability
                        that a given input and/or combination of elements inputs is associated with a given output to minimize the probability that
                        a given input is not associated with a given output. Scoring function may be expressed as a risk function representing an
                        “expected loss” of an algorithm relating inputs to outputs, where loss is computed as an error function representing a degree
                        to which a prediction generated by the relation is incorrect when compared to a given input-output pair provided in training
                        data 504. Persons skilled in the art, upon reviewing the entirety of this disclosure, will be aware of various possible variations
                        of at least a supervised machine-learning process 528 that may be used to determine relation between inputs and outputs. Supervised machine-learning processes may include classification
                        algorithms as defined above.
                     
                  
               
            
         
         
         
            
               
                  
                           With further reference to FIG. 5, training a supervised machine-learning process may include, without limitation, iteratively updating coefficients, biases,
                        weights based on an error function, expected loss, and/or risk function. For instance, an output generated by a supervised
                        machine-learning model using an input example in a training example may be compared to an output example from the training
                        example; an error function may be generated based on the comparison, which may include any error function suitable for use
                        with any machine-learning algorithm described in this disclosure, including a square of a difference between one or more sets
                        of compared values or the like. Such an error function may be used in turn to update one or more weights, biases, coefficients,
                        or other parameters of a machine-learning model through any suitable process including without limitation gradient descent
                        processes, least-squares processes, and/or other processes described in this disclosure. This may be done iteratively and/or
                        recursively to gradually tune such weights, biases, coefficients, or other parameters. Updating may be performed, in neural
                        networks, using one or more back-propagation algorithms. Iterative and/or recursive updates to weights, biases, coefficients,
                        or other parameters as described above may be performed until currently available training data is exhausted and/or until
                        a convergence test is passed, where a “convergence test” is a test for a condition selected as indicating that a model and/or
                        weights, biases, coefficients, or other parameters thereof has reached a degree of accuracy. A convergence test may, for instance,
                        compare a difference between two or more successive errors or error function values, where differences below a threshold amount
                        may be taken to indicate convergence. Alternatively or additionally, one or more errors and/or error function values evaluated
                        in training iterations may be compared to a threshold.
                     
                  
               
            
         
         
         
            
               
                  
                           Still referring to FIG. 5, a computing device, processor, and/or module may be configured to perform method, method step, sequence of method steps
                        and/or algorithm described in reference to this figure, in any order and with any degree of repetition. For instance, a computing
                        device, processor, and/or module may be configured to perform a single step, sequence and/or algorithm repeatedly until a
                        desired or commanded outcome is achieved; repetition of a step or a sequence of steps may be performed iteratively and/or
                        recursively using outputs of previous repetitions as inputs to subsequent repetitions, aggregating inputs and/or outputs of
                        repetitions to produce an aggregate result, reduction or decrement of one or more variables such as global variables, and/or
                        division of a larger processing task into a set of iteratively addressed smaller processing tasks. A computing device, processor,
                        and/or module may perform any step, sequence of steps, or algorithm in parallel, such as simultaneously and/or substantially
                        simultaneously performing a step two or more times using two or more parallel threads, processor cores, or the like; division
                        of tasks between parallel threads and/or processes may be performed according to any protocol suitable for division of tasks
                        between iterations. Persons skilled in the art, upon reviewing the entirety of this disclosure, will be aware of various ways
                        in which steps, sequences of steps, processing tasks, and/or data may be subdivided, shared, or otherwise dealt with using
                        iteration, recursion, and/or parallel processing.
                     
                  
               
            
         
         
         
            
               
                  
                           Further referring to FIG. 5, machine learning processes may include at least an unsupervised machine-learning processes 532. An unsupervised machine-learning process, as used herein, is a process that derives inferences in datasets without regard
                        to labels; as a result, an unsupervised machine-learning process may be free to discover any structure, relationship, and/or
                        correlation provided in the data. Unsupervised processes 532 may not require a response variable; unsupervised processes 532 may be used to find interesting patterns and/or inferences between variables, to determine a degree of correlation between
                        two or more variables, or the like.
                     
                  
               
            
         
         
         
            
               
                  
                           Still referring to FIG. 5, machine-learning module 500 may be designed and configured to create a machine-learning model 524 using techniques for development of linear regression models. Linear regression models may include ordinary least squares
                        regression, which aims to minimize the square of the difference between predicted outcomes and actual outcomes according to
                        an appropriate norm for measuring such a difference (e.g. a vector-space distance norm); coefficients of the resulting linear
                        equation may be modified to improve minimization. Linear regression models may include ridge regression methods, where the
                        function to be minimized includes the least-squares function plus term multiplying the square of each coefficient by a scalar
                        amount to penalize large coefficients. Linear regression models may include least absolute shrinkage and selection operator
                        (LASSO) models, in which ridge regression is combined with multiplying the least-squares term by a factor of 1 divided by
                        double the number of samples. Linear regression models may include a multi-task lasso model wherein the norm applied in the
                        least-squares term of the lasso model is the Frobenius norm amounting to the square root of the sum of squares of all terms.
                        Linear regression models may include the elastic net model, a multi-task elastic net model, a least angle regression model,
                        a LARS lasso model, an orthogonal matching pursuit model, a Bayesian regression model, a logistic regression model, a stochastic
                        gradient descent model, a perceptron model, a passive aggressive algorithm, a robustness regression model, a Huber regression
                        model, or any other suitable model that may occur to persons skilled in the art upon reviewing the entirety of this disclosure.
                        Linear regression models may be generalized in an embodiment to polynomial regression models, whereby a polynomial equation
                        (e.g. a quadratic, cubic or higher-order equation) providing a best predicted output/actual output fit is sought; similar
                        methods to those described above may be applied to minimize error functions, as will be apparent to persons skilled in the
                        art upon reviewing the entirety of this disclosure.

                        may include Gaussian processes such as Gaussian Process Regression. Machine-learning algorithms may include cross-decomposition
                        algorithms, including partial least squares and/or canonical correlation analysis. Machine-learning algorithms may include

                           Continuing to refer to FIG. 5, any process of training, retraining, deployment, and/or instantiation of any machine-learning model and/or algorithm may
                        be performed and/or repeated after an initial deployment and/or instantiation to correct, refine, and/or improve the machine-learning
                        model and/or algorithm. Such retraining, deployment, and/or instantiation may be performed as a periodic or regular process,
                        such as retraining, deployment, and/or instantiation at regular elapsed time periods, after some measure of volume such as
                        a number of bytes or other measures of data processed, a number of uses or performances of processes described in this disclosure,
                        or the like, and/or according to a software, firmware, or other update schedule. Alternatively or additionally, retraining,

                        like. Event-based retraining, deployment, and/or instantiation may alternatively or additionally be triggered by receipt and/or
                        generation of one or more new training examples; a number of new training examples may be compared to a preconfigured threshold,
                        where exceeding the preconfigured threshold may trigger retraining, deployment, and/or instantiation.

                        instructions, or the like, which may be added to and/or may replace existing hardware and/or software components, circuits,
                        instructions, or the like.
                     
                  
               
            
         
         
         
            
               
                  
                           Further referring to FIG. 5, one or more processes or algorithms described above may be performed by at least a dedicated hardware unit 536. A “dedicated hardware unit,” for the purposes of this figure, is a hardware component, circuit, or the like, aside from
                        a principal control circuit and/or processor performing method steps as described in this disclosure, that is specifically
                        designated or selected to perform one or more specific tasks and/or processes described in reference to this figure, such
                        as without limitation preconditioning and/or sanitization of training data and/or training a machine-learning algorithm and/or
                        model. A dedicated hardware unit 536 may include, without limitation, a hardware unit that can perform iterative or massed calculations, such as matrix-based
                        calculations to update or tune parameters, weights, coefficients, and/or biases of machine-learning models and/or neural networks,
                        efficiently using pipelining, parallel processing, or the like; such a hardware unit may be optimized for such processes by,
                        for instance, including dedicated circuitry for matrix and/or signal processing operations that includes, e.g., multiple arithmetic
                        and/or logical circuit units such as multipliers and/or adders that can act simultaneously and/or in parallel or the like.
                        Such dedicated hardware units 536 may include, without limitation, graphical processing units (GPUs), dedicated signal processing modules, FPGA or other reconfigurable
                        hardware that has been configured to instantiate parallel processing units for one or more specific tasks, or the like, A
                        computing device, processor, apparatus 100, or module may be configured to instruct one or more dedicated hardware units 536 to perform one or more operations described herein, such as evaluation of model and/or algorithm outputs, one-time or iterative
                        updates to parameters, coefficients, weights, and/or biases, and/or any other operations such as vector and/or matrix operations
                        as described in this disclosure.
                     
                  
               
            
         
         
         
            
               
                  
                           Referring now to FIG. 6, an exemplary embodiment of neural network 600 is illustrated. A neural network 600 also known as an artificial neural network, is a network of “nodes,” or data structures having one or more inputs, one or
                        more outputs, and a function determining outputs based on inputs. Such nodes may be organized in a network, such as without
                        limitation a convolutional neural network, including an input layer of nodes 604, one or more intermediate layers 608, and an output layer of nodes 612. Connections between nodes may be created via the process of “training” the network, in which elements from a training dataset
                        are applied to the input nodes, a suitable training algorithm (such as Levenberg-Marquardt, conjugate gradient, simulated
                        annealing, or other algorithms) is then used to adjust the connections and weights between nodes in adjacent layers of the
                        neural network to produce the desired values at the output nodes. This process is sometimes referred to as deep learning.
                        Connections may run solely from input nodes toward output nodes in a “feed-forward” network, or may feed outputs of one layer
                        back to inputs of the same or a different layer in a “recurrent network.” As a further non-limiting example, a neural network
                        may include a convolutional neural network comprising an input layer of nodes, one or more intermediate layers, and an output
                        layer of nodes. A “convolutional neural network,” as used in this disclosure, is a neural network in which at least one hidden
                        layer is a convolutional layer that convolves inputs to that layer with a subset of inputs known as a “kernel,” along with
                        one or more additional layers such as pooling layers, fully connected layers, and the like.
                     
                  
               
            
         
         
         
            
               
                  
                           Referring now to FIG. 7, an exemplary embodiment of a node 700 of a neural network is illustrated. A node may include, without limitation a plurality of inputs xi that may receive numerical values from inputs to a neural network containing the node and/or from other nodes. Node may perform
                        one or more activation functions to produce its output given one or more inputs, such as without limitation computing a binary
                        step function comparing an input to a threshold value and outputting either a logic 1 or logic 0 output or something equivalent,
                        a linear activation function whereby an output is directly proportional to the input, and/or a non-linear activation function,
                        wherein the output is not proportional to the input. Non-linear activation functions may include, without limitation, a sigmoid
                        function of the form

(NB)

                        
                        for some value of a (this function may be replaced and/or weighted by its own derivative in some embodiments), a softmax function
                        such as
                        
                     
                  
               
            
         
         
         
            
               
                  
                           
                        
(NB)

                        
                        where the inputs to an instant layer are xi, a swish function such as f(x)=x*sigmoid(x), a Gaussian error linear unit function such as f(x)=a(1+tanh(√{square root over
                        (2/π)}(x+bxr))) for some values of a, b, and r, and/or a scaled exponential linear unit function such as
                        
                     
                  
               
            
         
         
         
            
               
                  
                           
                        
(NB)

                        
                        Fundamentally, there is no limit to the nature of functions of inputs xi that may be used as activation functions. As a non-limiting and illustrative example, node may perform a weighted sum of inputs
                        using weights wi that are multiplied by respective inputs xi. Additionally or alternatively, a bias b may be added to the weighted sum of the inputs such that an offset is added to each
                        unit in the neural network layer that is independent of the input to the layer. The weighted sum may then be input into a
                        function p, which may generate one or more outputs y. Weight wi applied to an input xi may indicate whether the input is “excitatory,” indicating that it has strong influence on the one or more outputs y, for
                        instance by the corresponding weight having a large numerical value, and/or a “inhibitory,” indicating it has a weak effect
                        influence on the one more inputs y, for instance by the corresponding weight having a small numerical value. The values of
                        weights wi may be determined by training a neural network using training data, which may be performed using any suitable process as described
                        above.

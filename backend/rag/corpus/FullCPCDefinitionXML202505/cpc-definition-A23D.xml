<table-row><table-column><paragraph-text type="body">oil</paragraph-text></table-column><table-column><paragraph-text type="body">an oil is a substance that is in a viscous liquid state (&quot;oily&quot;) at ambient temperatures or slightly warmer, and is both hydrophobic (immiscible with water) and lipophilic (miscible with other oils, literally). This general definition includes compound classes with otherwise unrelated chemical structures, properties, and uses, including vegetable oils, petrochemical oils, and volatile essential oils. Oil is a nonpolar substance. The word &quot;oil&quot; is used for any substance that does not mix with water and has a greasy feel, such as petroleum (or crude oil) and heating oil, regardless of its chemical structure.</paragraph-text></table-column></table-row>
<table-row><table-column><paragraph-text type="body">edible oil</paragraph-text></table-column><table-column><paragraph-text type="body">edible or cooking oil is fat of plant, animal or microbial origin, which is liquid at room temperature and is suitable for food use. Some of the many different kinds of edible vegetable oils include: olive oil, palm oil, soybean oil, canola oil, pumpkin seed oil, corn oil, sunflower oil, safflower oil, peanut oil, grape seed oil, sesame oil, argan oil and rice bran oil. Many other kinds of vegetable oils are also used for cooking. The generic term &quot;vegetable oil&quot; when used to label a cooking oil product refers to a blend of a variety of oils often based on palm, corn, soybean or sunflower oils. Edible oil of animal origin is e.g. fish oil. Microbial oils are also encompassed.</paragraph-text></table-column></table-row>
<table-row><table-column><paragraph-text type="body">fats</paragraph-text></table-column><table-column><paragraph-text type="body">fats consist of a wide group of compounds that are generally soluble in organic solvents and largely insoluble in water. Chemically, fats are generally triesters of glycerol and fatty acids. Fats may be either solid or liquid at normal room temperature, depending on their structure and composition. Although the words &quot;oils&quot;, &quot;fats&quot;, and &quot;lipids&quot; are all used to refer to fats, &quot;oils&quot; is usually used to refer to fats that are liquids at normal room temperature, while &quot;fats&quot; is usually used to refer to lipids that are solids at normal room temperature. &quot;Lipids&quot; is used to refer to both liquid and solid fats, along with other related substances. Fats form a category of lipid, distinguished from other lipids by their chemical structure and physical properties. This category of molecules is important for many forms of life, serving both structural and metabolic functions. They are an important part of the diet of most heterotrophs (including humans). Fats or lipids are broken down in the body by enzymes called lipases produced in the pancreas.</paragraph-text></table-column></table-row>
<table-row><table-column><paragraph-text type="body">shortening</paragraph-text></table-column><table-column><paragraph-text type="body">shortening is a fat used in food preparation, especially baked goods, and is so called because it promotes a &quot;short&quot; or crumbly texture (as in shortbread). The term &quot;shortening&quot; can be used more broadly to apply to any fat that is used for baking and that is solid at room temperature, such as lard, but as used in recipes it refers to a hydrogenated vegetable oil that is solid at room temperature. Shortening generally has a higher smoke point than butter and margarine, and it may have 100% fat content, compared to about 80% for butter and margarine.</paragraph-text></table-column></table-row></table><paragraph-text type="body">Edible emulsions.</paragraph-text><paragraph-text type="body">Non-specified use of composition characterized by triglycerides.</paragraph-text></section-body></glossary-of-terms></definition-item>

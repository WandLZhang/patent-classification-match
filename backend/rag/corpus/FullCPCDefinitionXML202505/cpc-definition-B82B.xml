As a practical matter, what is intended by &quot;distinct&quot; in this phrase is that the only nanosized structures appropriate for this subclass are those that accomplish a function that is not inherent in the chemical or biological composition from which they are formed (e.g. a nanosized structure shaped so that an atom or molecule component is movable between locations to act as a switch in an electrical operation would be classified in&#160;<class-ref scheme="cpc">B82B</class-ref>&#160;even if it were formed using a method that included a chemical or biological step).</paragraph-text><paragraph-text type="body">The subclasses under section&#160;<class-ref scheme="cpc">C</class-ref>, &quot;Chemistry; Metallurgy&quot;, specifically provide for the majority of these excluded chemical or biological structures per se, or specially adapted processes or apparatus for the manufacture or treatment thereof (e.g. in classes&#160;<class-ref scheme="cpc">C08</class-ref>, <class-ref scheme="cpc">C12</class-ref>).</paragraph-text><paragraph-text type="body">For guidance as to whether classification in subclass <class-ref scheme="cpc">B82B</class-ref> applies, the following general principles of classification for <class-ref scheme="cpc">B82B</class-ref> under CPC are given.</paragraph-text><paragraph-text type="body">A device is classified in <class-ref scheme="cpc">B82B</class-ref> if:</paragraph-text><list><list-item><paragraph-text type="body">The device consists of a limited number of atoms, molecules or nanostructures, and</paragraph-text></list-item><list-item><paragraph-text type="body">The manufacturing process is a bottom-up process that manipulates and assembles a limited number of atoms, molecules or nanostructures.</paragraph-text></list-item></list><paragraph-text type="body">A method or an apparatus for manufacturing nanostructures is classified in <class-ref scheme="cpc">B82B</class-ref> if:</paragraph-text><list><list-item><paragraph-text type="body">The method is a bottom-up process.</paragraph-text></list-item><list-item><paragraph-text type="body">The apparatus manipulates and assembles a limited number of atoms, molecules or nanostructures.</paragraph-text></list-item></list><paragraph-text type="body">In relation to <class-ref scheme="cpc">B82B</class-ref> NOTE 3, which is about further classification in subclass <class-ref scheme="cpc">B82Y</class-ref>, it is noted that subclass <class-ref scheme="cpc">B82Y</class-ref> refers to obligatory supplementary classification relating in particular to specific uses or applications of nanostructures.

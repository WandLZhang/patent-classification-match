      <section-body><paragraph-text type="preamble">This place covers:</paragraph-text>
        <paragraph-text type="body">Steam traps defined by devices or special automatic valves for discharging condensate and non condensable gases from live steam with less possible loss or consumption of live steam. Furthermore not only steam traps are covered but also all kind of apparatus or valves and component parts and accessories thereof for draining-off liquids from enclosures, gas lines, steam lines or containers containing gases or vapours. Said valves are controlled thermally (thermostatically, bi-metallically driven valves), by excess or release of pressure (thermodynamically driven valves), by floats (mechanically driven valves) or controlled without moving parts (Venturi-type or labyrinth-type).</paragraph-text>

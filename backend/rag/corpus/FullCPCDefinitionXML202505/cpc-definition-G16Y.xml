Examples of such objects are: Objects, which perform specific functions with little or no electronic components, e.g. windows, doors or clothes; Objects, which include electronic components that perform specific functions independently from their functions for connecting to network, e.g. home electronic appliance and vehicles. On the other hand, generic computing and communicating devices, e.g. computer or laptop, on their own are not regarded as objects. However, in case that these devices are embedded in physical objects and enable the objects to sense and collect information and connect to network, then the devices can be regarded as a part of objects (the &quot;things&quot;). For example, smartphones, which are attached to vehicles to sense and deliver position data to a server, can be regarded as part of the objects.</paragraph-text></table-column></table-row>
